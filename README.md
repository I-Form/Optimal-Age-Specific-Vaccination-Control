# Optimal-Age-Specific-Vaccination-Control

This code can be used to simulate the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic with and without optimal vaccination control in place using our proposed compartmental model.
A preprint containing the model can be found on ArXiv and Researchgate under the title "A study on vaccination control for COVID-19 in Ireland".

The code was written in R.
